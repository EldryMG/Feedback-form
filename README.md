This is my version of Prime Digital Academy's Daily Reflections Form.  This was the perfect opportunity to practice Routing through different pages, and using Redux Store to better move data around your app. Although it wasn't the original intention, I was introduced to React Icons and MUI during the project; and I thought it'd be good practice to put some of those icons on the page..<br />
