weekend-redux-feedback-loop

## Description

This is my version of Prime Digital Academy's Daily Reflections Form.  This was the perfect opportunity to practice Routing through different pages, and using Redux Store to better move data around your app.

[x]-update README. ~15 mins, but ongoing.
[x]-Create the form components; "/feeling", "/understanding", "/support", "/comments" ~1 hour
[x]-Link together each blank page, importing from 'react-router-dom' HashRouter. ~45 mins, but these will likely need to be tweaked once data is being passed around.
[]-Complete Form on "/feeling", pass data to Redux.~1 hour
[]-Receive data from "/feeling".
[]-Repeat for "/understanding".
